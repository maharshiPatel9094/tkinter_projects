# Pomodoro Timer Project

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built using Python and Tkinter. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- **Work timer** (25 minutes)
- **Short break** (5 minutes)
- **Long break** (20 minutes after every 8 work sessions)
- **Visual countdown timer**
- **Checkmarks** to track completed work sessions

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter library** (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pomodoro-timer


## Usage 

1. Click the Start button to begin the timer.
2. The timer will alternate between work sessions and breaks, updating the display accordingly.
3. Click the Reset button to stop the timer and reset all values.
